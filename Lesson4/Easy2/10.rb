Benefits of OOP in Ruby

1. enables encapsulation - hiding pieces of functionality
which allow more complex programs
2. enables organization of code into hierarchical structures
and inheritance
3. enables code structure that enables reuse of different
pieces of code


1. Creating objects allows programmer to think
more abstractly about the code they are writing
2. Objects are represneted by nouns so are easier to 
conceptualize
3. It allows us to expose functionality to the parts of code
that need it, meaning namespace issues are less common
4. Allows us to easily give functionality to different
parts of an application without duplication
5. We can build applications faster as we can reuse
pre-written code
6. As the software becomes more complex, the complexity
can be more easily managed
