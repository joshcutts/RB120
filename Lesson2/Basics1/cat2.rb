class Cat
end

kitty = Cat.new

=begin

To intantiate a new `Cat` object, we use the class method `::new`. 
This method returns a new instance of the class it was invoked upon.
We now have a `Cat` object.

To make use of this new `Cat` object, we need to assign it to a variable. 
In the solution, we assign the object to a variable named `kitty`.
This variable can be used to interact with the object in various ways.
