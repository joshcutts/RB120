Defining a class is similar to defining a method, except for 2 notable differences
1) when defining a class, the reserved word `class` is used instead of `def`
2) when naming a class, the `CamelCase` format is used instead of `snake_case` format

classes like method, also use the reserved word `end` to finish the definition
